Resolution of 1mv is greater than that of 10mv.\n* But it also depends on the type of application. If 100mv is the measurement required then 10mv is a nice resolution and 1mv resolution will be redundant\n### Span and Range\n> Span: Linear operating range\n\n* This means that the relationship between two values must be a linear relation.\n> Range: Simple range (No explanation needed)\n\n### Best Fit Line\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-03-26.png)\n* Error is the difference between best fit value and the actual value.\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-09-13.png)\n> We take n-2 because measured values are mean and not true values and two variables are involved.\n\n## Computerized measurement and control systems\n### Development of software\n> Question to think: How to store the software or computer program in the circuit board?\n\n* General purpose computer is required to build a software for specific purpose computer.\n### Arduino Board\n* Components\n    * Input Pins (6 Analog Pins)\n    * Battery Connector/Receptor\n    * Output Pins (Analog)\n#  **Some part left**","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\YDNkGBLoHbT3jeeS0tRMf.html","relUrl":"notes\\YDNkGBLoHbT3jeeS0tRMf.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 2","title":"Lecture 2","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 2","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\ECJbtlwQWOE3dFIna0Lm3.html","relUrl":"notes\\ECJbtlwQWOE3dFIna0Lm3.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 1","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\yTD0dP4MoWNKpCeht3Wz3.html","relUrl":"notes\\yTD0dP4MoWNKpCeht3Wz3.html"},{"doc":"Operating System","title":"Operating System","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\OGq6U8MXIG3wwETNLR4b6.html","relUrl":"notes\\OGq6U8MXIG3wwETNLR4b6.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 1","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\ze7K28mUdIHg5Z137Vucz.html","relUrl":"notes\\ze7K28mUdIHg5Z137Vucz.html"},{"doc":"Music","title":"Music","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Music","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\YfEhInqFt0RCqjRYQvTlf.html","relUrl":"notes\\YfEhInqFt0RCqjRYQvTlf.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Music.Lecture 1","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\BpPndOdyo69WT64AEoDns.html","relUrl":"notes\\BpPndOdyo69WT64AEoDns.html"},{"doc":"Material Science and Engineering","title":"Material Science and Engineering","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\SkPPj7voTTRpF7d0XMYNV.html","relUrl":"notes\\SkPPj7voTTRpF7d0XMYNV.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 3","title":"Lecture 3","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 3","content":"\n# Crystal Lattice\n\n### Sorry for the inconvinience but please refer this [site](https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes/omAwLOv3wYSYrihgzYlu4.html) for lecture 3 notes.","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\hvEDw5kSoIcX03j2YJdL9.html","relUrl":"notes\\hvEDw5kSoIcX03j2YJdL9.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 2","title":"Lecture 2","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 2","content":"\n# Atomic Structure, Bonding and Energy\n\n## Classification of materials\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-10-22-07.png)\n\n* Types of materials\n    \n    * Semiconductor\n    * Polymer\n    * Metals\n    * Ceramics\n    * Biomaterials\n    * Composites\n\n> Composite material is formed by the combination of two or more types of materials. But why do we need composite materials?\n\n* Reduce Weight\n* Lowers the cost of the material\n* Gives strength to the device\n* **Mediates propogation of charge/current**\n\n## Atomic structure\n\n* Atomic mass unit = 1/12 of the mass of most common isotope of carbon.\n* Atomic weight is weighted average of atomic masses of naturally occuring isotopes.\n* A mole is amount of matter with mass in grams equal to atomic mass in amu.\n* A mole of carbon has a mass of 12 grams.\n* **One mole has 6.023 x 10^23 number of atoms (also called as Avogadro's number)**\n* Number density formula: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-14-09.png)\n\nHere Nav = avogadro's number, $\\rho$ = mass density and A = atomic mass\n\n* De broglie wavelength: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-58-00.png)\n\n* Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-58-34.png)\n\n### Electronic Structure of isolated atoms\n* n  principal shell (1,2,3... or K,L,M...)\n* l = anular (sub shell) (s,p,d,f)\n* ml = magnetic (-l to +l including 0)\n* ms = spin (1/2, -1/2)\n\n> Ionization potential is the energy required to pull out a valence electron (in vacuum) and by convention it is positive. Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.\n\n> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.\n\n* Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical\n* Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.\n* This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.\n\n## Physical properties in Periodic table\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-08-27.png)\n\n## Bonding in solids\n* At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.\n* These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-12-56.png)\n\n* Fnet = Fr + Fa. At equilibrium Fnet = 0\n\n## Potential Energy\n\n> **Here potential energy and energy are used interchangebly.**\n\n* Energy is integration of foice wrt the radius.\n* Enet = Ea + Er.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-17-07.png)\n\n* Attraction energy = -A/r and Repulsive energy = B/power(r,n)\n* E0 = Bonding energy at minimum distance. This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms.\n* It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.\n* If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.\n* To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.\n\n## Ionic Bonding\n* **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**\n* Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion\n* Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\n* Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature.\n* Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\n* Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\n\n## Covalent Bonding\n* **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\n* Percent of ionic characters:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\n\n* Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\n\n## Summary of Bonding\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\3Ez0kXjxHUD43Yc6H2vMR.html","relUrl":"notes\\3Ez0kXjxHUD43Yc6H2vMR.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 1","content":"\n# Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\n\n## Points to Ponder\n* With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.
