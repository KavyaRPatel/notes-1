Resolution of 1mv is greater than that of 10mv.\n* But it also depends on the type of application. If 100mv is the measurement required then 10mv is a nice resolution and 1mv resolution will be redundant\n### Span and Range\n> Span: Linear operating range\n\n* This means that the relationship between two values must be a linear relation.\n> Range: Simple range (No explanation needed)\n\n### Best Fit Line\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-03-26.png)\n* Error is the difference between best fit value and the actual value.\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-09-13.png)\n> We take n-2 because measured values are mean and not true values and two variables are involved.\n\n## Computerized measurement and control systems\n### Development of software\n> Question to think: How to store the software or computer program in the circuit board?\n\n* General purpose computer is required to build a software for specific purpose computer.\n### Arduino Board\n* Components\n    * Input Pins (6 Analog Pins)\n    * Battery Connector/Receptor\n    * Output Pins (Analog)\n#  **Some part left**","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\YDNkGBLoHbT3jeeS0tRMf.html","relUrl":"notes\\YDNkGBLoHbT3jeeS0tRMf.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 2","title":"Lecture 2","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 2","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\ECJbtlwQWOE3dFIna0Lm3.html","relUrl":"notes\\ECJbtlwQWOE3dFIna0Lm3.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\yTD0dP4MoWNKpCeht3Wz3.html","relUrl":"notes\\yTD0dP4MoWNKpCeht3Wz3.html"},{"doc":"Embedded Systems","title":"Embedded Systems","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\a1PatlsCiz7PYsL111lFm.html","relUrl":"notes\\a1PatlsCiz7PYsL111lFm.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\wIwPNNBh5jeugRuj1Bhsv.html","relUrl":"notes\\wIwPNNBh5jeugRuj1Bhsv.html"},{"doc":"Heritage Conservation","title":"Heritage Conservation","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\znYlAnqQDCB58XxxMMdIl.html","relUrl":"notes\\znYlAnqQDCB58XxxMMdIl.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\SJH5ZSmDfPD1UrQmDVlHq.html","relUrl":"notes\\SJH5ZSmDfPD1UrQmDVlHq.html"},{"doc":"Identity and Behaviour","title":"Identity and Behaviour","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Identity and Behaviour","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\elcUWYUkVJfjM5NLR8toR.html","relUrl":"notes\\elcUWYUkVJfjM5NLR8toR.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Identity and Behaviour.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\D9wwwfHBU8FZT1kN8UJVO.html","relUrl":"notes\\D9wwwfHBU8FZT1kN8UJVO.html"},{"doc":"Material Science and Engineering","title":"Material Science and Engineering","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\SkPPj7voTTRpF7d0XMYNV.html","relUrl":"notes\\SkPPj7voTTRpF7d0XMYNV.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\Q0Qv4OOrtgWPGOXojo4iy.html","relUrl":"notes\\Q0Qv4OOrtgWPGOXojo4iy.html"},{"doc":"Music","title":"Music","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Music","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\YfEhInqFt0RCqjRYQvTlf.html","relUrl":"notes\\YfEhInqFt0RCqjRYQvTlf.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Music.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\BpPndOdyo69WT64AEoDns.html","relUrl":"notes\\BpPndOdyo69WT64AEoDns.html"},{"doc":"Operating System","title":"Operating System","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\OGq6U8MXIG3wwETNLR4b6.html","relUrl":"notes\\OGq6U8MXIG3wwETNLR4b6.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 1","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\ze7K28mUdIHg5Z137Vucz.html","relUrl":"notes\\ze7K28mUdIHg5Z137Vucz.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\changelog.html","relUrl":"notes\\changelog.html"}]
