Resolution of 1mv is greater than that of 10mv.\n* But it also depends on the type of application. If 100mv is the measurement required then 10mv is a nice resolution and 1mv resolution will be redundant\n### Span and Range\n> Span: Linear operating range\n\n* This means that the relationship between two values must be a linear relation.\n> Range: Simple range (No explanation needed)\n\n### Best Fit Line\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-03-26.png)\n* Error is the difference between best fit value and the actual value.\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-10-09-13.png)\n> We take n-2 because measured values are mean and not true values and two variables are involved.\n\n## Computerized measurement and control systems\n### Development of software\n> Question to think: How to store the software or computer program in the circuit board?\n\n* General purpose computer is required to build a software for specific purpose computer.\n### Arduino Board\n* Components\n    * Input Pins (6 Analog Pins)\n    * Battery Connector/Receptor\n    * Output Pins (Analog)\n# **Some part left**","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\5YpMJ0rhPVIRzqk1gaTcx.html","relUrl":"notes\\5YpMJ0rhPVIRzqk1gaTcx.html"},{"doc":"OS","title":"OS","hpath":"courses.sem5.OS","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\kvhHzoHo7aNudlwG006eb.html","relUrl":"notes\\kvhHzoHo7aNudlwG006eb.html"},{"doc":"L1","title":"L1","hpath":"courses.sem5.OS.L1","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\Wh78zOvSqRMRqUevKxfCa.html","relUrl":"notes\\Wh78zOvSqRMRqUevKxfCa.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\changelog.html","relUrl":"notes\\changelog.html"}]
