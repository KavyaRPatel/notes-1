* Funnctionalist, Structuralist, Behaviourist (1,2)
* Gestalt psychology -  (fill in incomplete) (2)
* Johari Window (2)
* Organisation-Behaviourist model {input, process, output}(3)
* Learning (4)
* Experience (4)
* Classical conditioning {uncn/cnditn stim/resp}(4)
* Operant conditioning {behaviour is fn of consequences}(4)
* Social Learning Theory {Observing others and gaining exp} (5)
    * Vicarious reinforcement {nto imp to behave, but can observe and get experience}
    * Attention, Retention, Motor reproduction, reinforcement
* Piaget's (6)
    * Schemes - Assimilationand Acomodation
    * Operation - Cause and effect, Conservation of substance
    * 4 stages in children
* Vigotsky's (6)
* Zone of Proximal Development {scaffolding} (7)
* Perception {Factors: Perceiver, Target Setting | conflict - motive, interest, expectations}(7)
* Attribution Theory {Internal or extrnal behaviour DISCCO-CAB} (8)
* Errors in Perception
    * Fundamental Attributuon err {judge others, external f << Internal fact}
    * Self serving bias {Ourselves, subjective blae on ext or int}
* Shortcut in judging/ perception
    * Selective perception {choose to interpret}
    * Halo effect
    * Horn Effect
    * Stereotyping
* Rational descision making model {Explore all possibilities} (10)
* Bounded Rationality {Not all, but optmiz value} (10)
* Intution {uNconcious process out of experience} (10)
* Bias in descision making
    * **Escalation of Commitment**  
        * an increased commitment to a
previous decision despite negative information.
    * **Availability Bias**
        * the tendency for people to base their judgments on information that is readily available to
them
    * **Overconfidence bias**- tendency to overestimate your own
abilities
        * Individuals whose intellectual and interpersonal abilities are weakest
are most likely to have this Bias 
        *  Research indicated that there is negative correlation between
entrepreneurs confidence and success rate
    * **Randomness error**
        * tendency of individuals to believe that they
can predict the outcome of random events e.g. wearing ___
shirt/top to an exam/interview is lucky.
    * **Hindsight bias**: 
        * tendency to
believe falsely, after an
outcome of an event is
actually known, that one
would have accurately
predicted that outcome. E.g.
AU Convocation in 2019.
    * **Confirmation bias:** 
        * tendency to seek out information that
reaffirms past choices and to discount information that
contradicts past judgments. E.g. for/against debate.
* Values 
    * basic convictions about what is right, good, or desirable
    * Terminal vs. Instrumental Values
    * Terminal values: desirable end-states of existence.
    * Instrumental values: preferred modes of behavior or means of
    achieving terminal values. 
    * Values are convictions that a specific mode of conduct or end state
    of existence is personally or socially preferable over an opposing
    mode of conduct or end state of existence.
* Person-Organization Fit
    * People who are extrovert and outspoken fit well with aggressive and teamoriented cultures.
    * People high on agreeableness match up better with a supportive
    organizational climate than one focused on aggressiveness.
    * People high on openness to experience fit better in organizations that emphasize innovation rather than standardization.

 
## Psycology
* The science of behaviour and mind 
* Application of science to solve human problems
* Feelings - unobservable | Behaviour - observable actions
* Science is gaining knowledge by observation and experimentation
## Structuralism
* Break down into its constituent elements (sensation/emotions/feelings)
* Method: Introspection
* What questions: "What were you feeling"
* **Problems**  
    * Got all elements but cannot comphrehend well about the function.
## Functionalist
* mind and behaviour is adaptive(perp for exam/ playing..)
* How learning/ memory happens
* Why questions
* **Problems**  
    * No scientific method to determine/ observe mind
## Behaviorism
* Observe - Experiment - Analyse
* Should study behaviour instead of mind
* 3 beliefs of behaviouralist
    * Complex behavious are orn from the pre elementry knwledge
    * Focus on learnd behviour not inbuilt 
    * humans and animals are same
* **Problems**
    * Focuses onnly on behaviour, whats inside mind is missed out 
## Gestalt psycologist 
* Mind works as whole and not in parts
* Mind triesto find patterns

## Organisational Behaviour Model
* Framework: Input, Process, Output
* EG:  
    * **Individual level:** Humans are the inputs, feelings/emotions are process, output is our work
    * **Group Level:** coordination etc
    * **Organisation level:** culture, structure

## Learning
Relatively permenant change in ones behaviour due to an experience(affecting ones sensory systems)
## Classical conditioning
* Conditioned Stimulus - condition that accompanies natural stimulus
* Unonditioned Stimulus - natural event
* Conditioned Response - behaviour for conditioned stimulus
* Unconditioned Response - how do we react naturally
## Operant Conditioning
* Behvaiour is function of consequences
## Social Learning Theory
* Individuals learn by observing others and gaining experiencing   
* **Vicarious reinforceents** - Not necessary to behave in perticular manner to know output, you can observe and and reinforce some actions
* People respond on how they percieve and define consequences NOT to the objective consequences. **_Can be different_**

* Children learn by exploring and playing
