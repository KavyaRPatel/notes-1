# X-ray Diffraction (XRD)

## Key Points
* [Site](http://calistry.org/calculate/latticePlanesMillerIndices) to view miller indices and planes easily.
* When two waves are in sync with the phase of each other, it is called constructive interference and vice versa.
* In case of constructive interference, the amplitude of the final wave will be added and vice versa.

* Here d = interplanar spacing will remain the same for a particular material.
* We would be using copper k-alpha. Advatage is immediate cooling of the metal.
* Copper k-beta gives very low intensity and hence is avoided for XRD study.
* Wavelength of XRD = 1.54 angstrom (fixed for all calculation).
* **For diffraction to occur, 2dsin($\theta$) = n$\lambda$ must be satisfied where n = order of reflexion.**
* **Always take n=1 unless specified. n = 1 implies first order diffraction.**

> Key Question: How to decide which element to take (like Copper, Molebdenum or Cobalt)?
* So in such cases, first we check the intentsity and then the d-spacing as it remains the same for the same material.

## X-Ray Diffractogram
> Curve between intensity and diffraction angle (2$\theta$).

## How to identify which crystal structure? (SC, BCC or FCC)
* For that we have to calculate $h^2$ + $k^2$ + $l^2$ where h,k and l are the miller indices.
* Then use the below image.

    * For SC, always calculate till 8th step and **show that 7 is absent/missing.**
    * If 7 comes in the series then multiply the whole series with 2 to get BCC structure.
