# Uniprocessor Scheduling Algorithms

* We would be discussing only short-term scheduling.
* They mainly include dispatching techniques.
* Algorithms available

* Normalized TAT is better quantity.

## CPU Bound and I/O Bound
* If a process spends most of its time in processor, then it is called CPU bound and vice versa is I/O bound.

## FCFS

* It is one of the most fair strategy in the **real world.**
* w = waiting time.

## Extra Points
* DMA - Data memory access is a hardware circuit through which all the data is transfered after an I/O is available.
