# Directions and Planes

## Density Computation
* $\rho$ = $\frac{nA}{VcNa}$
* Here $\rho$ is the density, n is the number of atoms in a unit cell, A is the atomic mass of the element, Vc is the volume of unit cell and Na is the avogadro's number.

## Crystal Directions
> These include linear density and planar density

> Always divide by the biggest number. Eg. 4th case in the above image.

## Extra points
* To represent direction, use square brackets.
* To represent plane, use round brackets.
* Parallel planes belong to the same **family** of planes.
* To represent family of planes, use curly brackets.
* To represent family of directions, use angular brackets.
* There should not be comma between numbers in either of the cases.


> Why are planes in a lattice important?
* Determining crystal structure
* Plastic deformation
* Transport properties

## Miller Indices
* This is one of the information required to study X-Ray defractogram
* Procedure to find these indices
    * Note the intercepts made by plane in terms of **lattice constants** a,b and c.
    * Note the coefficient of the intercepts.
    * Find inverse of them.
    * Find LCM and multiply them by LCM.
    * These points that you get are the Miller indices.

## How to draw planes?
* Quite confusing, read book

## Angle between planes
