# Lecture 3: 
### Points
* With one value of x, take many values of y and then take the average
* Error can occur at input as well as output side
### Standard Error and Standard Deviation
> Measures how much discrepancy (difference) is likely to be in the sample mean and the population mean.

* Std Dev = Spread of data around the mean

* In excel, multiply by sqrt(nx) and divide by sqrt(nx-1) to get the correct result

### Precision
> Degree of reproducibility of a measurement

* Accuracy and precision are different. **Outputs** for calculation is close enough then your calculation is precise but accuracy depends on the whether the output values are close to the actual value means it is accurate.
* It is also possible that the output is more accurate and less precice and vice versa.
### Resolution
> Smallest measurable increment

* Eg. Resolution of 1mv is greater than that of 10mv.
* But it also depends on the type of application. If 100mv is the measurement required then 10mv is a nice resolution and 1mv resolution will be redundant
### Span and Range
> Span: Linear operating range

* This means that the relationship between two values must be a linear relation.
> Range: Simple range (No explanation needed)

### Best Fit Line

* Error is the difference between best fit value and the actual value.

> We take n-2 because measured values are mean and not true values and two variables are involved.

## Computerized measurement and control systems
### Development of software
> Question to think: How to store the software or computer program in the circuit board?

* General purpose computer is required to build a software for specific purpose computer.
### Arduino Board
* Components
    * Input Pins (6 Analog Pins)
    * Battery Connector/Receptor
    * Output Pins (Analog)
